# SimpleSplines
A header only library for linead, quadratic, and cubic spline interpolation in C++.


For the moment, the code is copied from the [*ASAP*](https://dkaramit.github.io/ASAP) project. So the code is quite simple, but works well, too. I will try to impove it here, though.  


Cheers,
Dimitris
